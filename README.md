# CSS Changes 
    -   To remove border around my logo in sidebar I renamed the class name to .thumbnail-new found in layout.pug. I removed the border from the orignial .thumbnail class and applied the same, original styling to .thumbnail-new. I then separately applied the border to thumbnail class only.
        Styling can be found in foundation.css 4987 - 4996
    
    -   Added A logo

    - I've added a transform on hover to the thumbnails.
